Perhaps due to the zodiac year, I have experienced countless setbacks this year. On this kagerou day, I would like to write a summary and pray a good luck.</p>
<h2 id="About-school"><a href="#About-school" class="headerlink" title="About school"></a>About school</h2><p>&emsp;&emsp;Northeastern University at Qinhuangdao, at that time, My score was only enough for the normal 211 school, but I accidentally came across this school while browsing various volunteer analysis software. In terms of geography, Qinhuangdao is BeiJing’s back garden; In terms of school, 985 is not at a loss; In terms of major, computer science has an A - (seems like it achieved an A now, so I think I had made some contribution as well?). The disadvantage is that the school is small and the postgraduate recommendation rate is low, but it’s not a problem for me. So I just put Tsinghua University and Peking University in front of your choices, after all, one still need to have dreams in life. Put the Three Gorges water conservancy and hydropower in the back. If NEUQ refuse me, I’d go to Three Gorges Dam do some daily work.</p>

</div> 


<p>&emsp;&emsp;After arriving, I found that the island was really nice, with a good environment, low prices, and very easy-going people. As soon as I arrived, I went through Shanhaiguan, Laolongtou, Pigeon’s Nest Park, Biluota, Anaya, Xigang Garden, Maoye, Wanda, and so on. The teachers on campus are very responsible, and you can discuss the current situation with ideological and political teachers (Me: I think it’s half capitalism and half feudalism); Discussing the cultural differences between Chinese and English mythology with a humanities teacher (From my point of view one emphasizes divinity while the other emphasizes humanity); And doubt the textbook answers with the math teacher (Me: These are all wrong no matter how I calculate them. Teacher: The textbook has been wrong for several years and is still misleading people.) Outside of school, there used to be a stylish private bar next to the marriage registration office on the north side of the school. At that time, I often joked with my classmates about getting drunk and going to register next to it. Ordering drinks and serving free snacks, occasionally singing folk songs with guitar. The last time I went, the boss said he was heartbroken for been dumped. After chatting, he even not accept the money, and then the small shop closed down; There is a barber in Block B of Maoye who has drifted around major cities for several years. Finally, he returned to the island and opened his own shop for haircuts. He has a good understanding of various hairstyles and adopts a reservation system. It is common for him to take a half&#x2F;whole day break for a day in case of emergencies, which gives him a lot of freedom; There is a handmade small shop next to the old railway tracks in Xigang Garden. The shop owner used to be a photography editor in BeiJing, but later pursued work life balance and returned to the island to keep the shop. When entering the shop, you often see her creating oil paintings… Maybe it’s true that there is mutual attraction between stand masters</p>

<h2 id="About-clubs"><a href="#About-clubs" class="headerlink" title="About clubs"></a>About clubs</h2><p>&emsp;&emsp;Seeing that many experience posts now say that university students should not focus on clubs but on academic performance. I cannot help but feel a sense of regret that internal competition and utilitarianism have already reached this stage. At the time of my enrollment, the mainstream view was to add one or two clubs to broaden one’s horizons and meet like-minded people. After weighing the pros and cons, I joined the school student union and ACM competition team. The senior sister in the school student union treated me well, and she even acted as a matchmaker for me several times when I’m absent from morning exercises and evening self-study and worry about the attendance records. During my tenure, I worked with many students from other institutes, and I continued to carry forward this excellent tradition of caring about junior brother&#x2F;sister during the transition. The ACM competition team took up most of my freshman and sophomore years, and I ended up with ACM silver medal, which is considered a fruitful achievement. In fact, I can also mention laboratory related topics. But after completing an OpenGL project for the first project and feeling that it was far from the industry, I decided to mainly focus on my own direction.</p>

<h2 id="About-internship"><a href="#About-internship" class="headerlink" title="About internship"></a>About internship</h2><p>&emsp;&emsp;I personally choose game program as my direction, after all, I feel that technology is the most difficult part. In my sophomore year, by chance, I was selected for the Baiao Z * T training camp (after all, the requirement was junior year). In my junior year, I successfully interned at Timi game engine team, so I can be considered as have both client and engine experience. Overall, internships can really bring a lot to people, both in terms of cognition and technology. Another thing worth mentioning is that all of my internships are in different locations from school, and some schools may not allow this. You have to find your own solutions. However, as long as the results are acceptable, just go ahead and do it.</p>

<h2 id="About-study"><a href="#About-study" class="headerlink" title="About study"></a>About study</h2><p>&emsp;&emsp;First of all, let me say that study here is broad and not limited to school, after all, in my opinion, school delays study. When it comes to school, I only take my GPA seriously in my freshman year (so I won many awards and was choosed to the computer science department), and then I skipped various classes to participate in laboratory and competitions, and the skipped school for internships. During the Covid-19, despite the city’s opening up, the foolish leaders still closed the school every day. I fully demonstrated the ability of a field athlete in the academy, climbing over the wall in the dark night to play maimai DX for many times (voice over: Study? study nothing!).</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;Outside of school, my studies mainly include game development and rendering animations, including but not limited to Unity (Script, Editor, Shader, Simulation), OpenGL, Taichi, Pandas3d… I am purely self-taught, but I also want to thank some seniors for sharing. Here is a brief list of the order in which I have come into contact with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://space.bilibili.com/508934306">夏村散人韩老师</a>(Principles and Applications of Game Engines), <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://space.bilibili.com/211153830">傅老師MrFu</a>(OpenGL series), <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://space.bilibili.com/370283072">M_Studio</a>(Famous Little Fox), <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://space.bilibili.com/512313464">GAMES Webinar</a>(GAMES series), as well as colleagues from the company and laboratory teachers from the school.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;At the time of graduation, I wanted to do a big job, so I resigned and returned to school, choosing to develop an independent game as my graduation project. The theme shooting battle is a wish from the past, and the graffiti on the art paper is to commemorate the era of writing, drawing, and constructing games on notebooks. And I also add some co creation elements during the game guidance to commemorate.</p>

<h2 id="About-studying-abroad"><a href="#About-studying-abroad" class="headerlink" title="About studying abroad"></a>About studying abroad</h2><p>&emsp;&emsp;I didn’t stay in the company, mainly because I don’t have much personal pursuit of money, as long as enough for living, and I don’t consider cars, house, marriage or anything like that. But I hope to have more personal time to study technology, learn some drawing, Japanese, play guitar, and make&#x2F;play some interesting games. Everyone knows the situation in China, so I won’t go into too much detail. After all, when I resigned and returned to school, some classmates even said that I was crazy. After all, the ups and downs are only self aware.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;So studying abroad to have a look became a choice, after a brief communication with parents, they were told that it would be fine for one or two years. So I mainly applied to the United States, with reference by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/352511849">Jerusalem</a> for Europe application. Later, USC and Utah both give me an offer, and it was only then that I realized my parents’ claim of no problem was that they planned to borrow money from relatives, so I refused both. I thought I can surely be admitted by one Sweden university but all my Sweden applies are declined. Finally I only kept Utrecht’s GMT offer. Gap means a lot of disadvantageous. In the end, I chose to go there, hoping to study AI and crowd simulation.</p>
<h2 id="About-future"><a href="#About-future" class="headerlink" title="About future"></a>About future</h2><p>&emsp;&emsp;I don’t know, maybe I need to borrow Xifeng Zhang’s “It’s okay to be alive, it’s okay to be dead “. When I went back to school in the laboratory for graduation reply and said this, the teacher replied that if I had any difficulties, he could offer help. If I wasn’t succeed, I could also return to the school to take up a position. Every time I think of it, it brings warmth. So Why am I obsessed with games? I don’t have the ambition like Xinyun Mao. I just believe that I should be a creator and want to bring something different to players though the most interactive form of creation, gaming.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;Before leaving, I divinated a hexagram. The original hexagram is the oppression hexagram, and the moving parts are six and two. “He is oppressed by creeping vines. He moves uncertainly and says, ‘Movement brings remorse.’ If one feels remorse over this and makes a start, Good fortune comes.” This is similar to the message in “The Story Left Behind”: “Percept as you travel, Try your very best, Not fear the unknown, Not regret your choice”. Then just do it. If I failed, then go back to the island and become a teacher &#x2F; take a full prize literature master’s degree and transfer to game designer &#x2F; take a few more years for position doctor studies. Throughout people’s lives, success always comes after numerous failures.</p>
